What does it do?
----------------

This extension was created by Kasper Skårhøj for the tutorial Modern Template Building Part 1+2.
It allows backend users to choose a different external HTML-template for each page. This
especially makes sense when users are not allowed to touch the real template record but need the
ability to change the layout of their page.

I added some new features to the original extension which also allows you to use pure TypoScript
templates instead of external HTML files. You should read the section in the tutorial to get
a better idea of how this extension works, since everything will be explained there right from the
start. Nevertheless you can also use this extension without reading the tutorial, since the most
important steps will be explained here, too.

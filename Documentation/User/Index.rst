User manual
===========

If the webdesigner and the administrator of your TYPO3 site have configured everything properly,
it's really easy to choose a different template for your page. Just create a new page (or use an
existing one) and switch to tab `Extended` in page-properties.

Scroll down the entire form and on the bottom you'll find the template selector. It will show
all templates that are available for your website (of course your webdesigner or TYPO3-Admin
will have to create them first). Depending on your website you may choose between a main template
and a template for the content area.

Just make your choice and save the modified page. Depending on the template you have
chosen, you now might have more or less columns available for filling with content. Please ask
your webdesigner for your website's layout details.
